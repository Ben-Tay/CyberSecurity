## Threats & Breaches

#### Hardware Threats
Weak security policies can leard to physical threats, tampering or hardware theft
* Only trusted, authorized personnel `should have physical access` to information systems and only `for the specific systems they are responsible for`.
* Much easier to steal data `directly` from a laptop or server as opposed to remotely hack into a complex network
#### Safety mechanisms
* Keep hardware safe & secured in lock area (card reader to limit access)
* Robust surveilance `in and out` of premises
* Keep security solutions updated, maintained and tested
* Regular planning, maintenance and backups as well as `mock disaster` scenarios will help to `refine processes & identify security weaknesses`

## Data Threats
> Unpatched systems, misconfigured firewalls, weak cybersecurity, and weak physical security
are just a few ways that data threats occur.

`Data Leaks`
* Accidental exposure of confidential or sensitive data through a security vulnerability.

`Data Breaches`
* Data leaks caused `intentionally` by a cybercriminal
* Occurs when `social engineering` or `phishing` attacks tricks employees into `leaking sensitive info`.

`Data Dumps`
* When cybercriminals dump stolen data onto the dark web for monetary gain.
* Eg of such data: PII, PHI, bank account numbers, PINS, SSNS etc
* Other cybercriminals buy and use data dumps for things like `identity theft and password attacks`

`Dumpster Diving`
* Act of literally searching through a literal dumpster to find `something valuable`
* Company's thrash might contain valuable info such as:
    1. Product Design, Biz Plans, Phone Numbers
    2. Contact Info, Cust Names, Access codes etc 
> Shreeding and device destruction should be normal part of biz so that sensitive info is not leaked. Any of this leaked info could be used for `identity theft` and `data breaches`

## Insider Threats
> Threats from within an organization

Employes are insider threats if they:
* Sell valuable Information
* Hurt or embarass the company
* Give away valuable credentials or data accidentally

Hackers can also:
* Blackmail employees to recruit insiders by `promising some incentive or reward`

## Software Threats
> Includes theft, exploits and malwares

`Software/License thefts`
* Unauthorized copy or use of `copyright-protected` software
* Eg: `Pirating software/activating counterfeit activation codes`

`Exploits`
* Pieces of code that uses vulnerabilities in a hardware or software to get `into` the system
* Malware-infected websites use exploits to automatically download malware to a system (Drive-by download)

`Malware`
* General term for software `designed to compromise` computer systems
* Can cause:
    1. System slowdowns/odd requests/browser misdirections/add popup adds
    2. steal data/record activity/spam contacts
    3. Connect you to malicious networks (that are hijacked and remotely controlled) - `aka botnet`

Comes from:
    1. Sketchy websites/Attachments
    2. File downloads, infected drives
    3. Suspicious Links

To avoid malware: 
* Backup data, do not open strange attachments or links
* Keep software updated, use `antivirus`
* Strong, frequently updated passwords

#### Malware Types
`Viruses` 
* Spread from `host to host` and is started by a user for it to activate 
* Can turn on webcams, record keystrokes, site visits, steal data & corrupt files, HIJACK EMAILS

Program Virus - bits of code that insert themselves into another program

Macro Virus - affect MsOffice files via the macros they use to automate tasks

Stealth Viruses - copy themselves into different locations to `avoid antivirus scans`.

Polymorphic Viruses (97%)
* Change their characteristics to `get around cybersecurity defences`.

`RootKit`
* Program that provides attacker with `elevated access to a computer`
* Program has control over computer w/o user or target system's knowledge

`Worms`
* Viruses that start themselves after `idenfitying system weaknesses`
* Can replicate itself from one device to another across a network w/o human interaction
* Can be used to `delete files, steal info, create backdoor, distribute other malware`
* They don't rely on app or files 
* Can be controlled remotely

`Trojans`
* Trick you into installing legitimate-seeming software that includes harmful malware.

`Spyware`
* Records using a device's camera or microphone
* Collects personal data, login information, credit card information, online activity 

`Adware`
- Software coded into online ads that records your personal data, website visits, and keystrokes to send you personalized ads.
- Can sometimes lead to `inadvertent downloads` of other malware and also slows down pc


> Adware & Spyware can be `legitimate or malicious`

`Ransomware`
- Locks a system, encrypts its files, and displays a ransom demand
- To get decryption key, must pay the ransom to be able to gain access to files
- Or you can regain access by doing a full system restore from a backup.
 - `Phishing, Remote Desktop Protocol`
