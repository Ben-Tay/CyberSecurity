### CyberSecurity definition
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks typically include business interruptions or the theft, tampering, or destruction of sensitive information.


Learning Objectives
* Explain how to keep data safe, confidential, and tamper-resistant
* Define what data is, how it drives business decisions, and how companies manage it
* Identify security threats like hacking, data theft, malware, and data leaks
* List other types of attack vectors used by cybercriminals

## Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA Triad)
#### Confidentiality
* Data is `protected from unauthorized access`
* Control `unauthorized data sharing` to ensure privacy
* If confidential data is exposed to the wrong audience could lead to risks such as:
    * `Identity Theft/Compromised accounts`
    * `Legal Concerns/Damage to Reputation`

##### Determining if data should be confidential
* Who is Authorized?
* Do Confidentiality Regulations Apply?
* Any conditions for data to be accessed/Impact of disclosure?
* Is the data valuable
* For data security we `need to control data access` and use security tools like `encryption & multi-factor authentication (MFA)`.

#### Integrity
* Data is `protected from unauthorized changes`
* Data Integrity guarantees that `data is accurate, complete and consistent` even when transferring across sytems and being updated 
* Integrity across `Storage/Processing/Transit`
* Any `corruption/loss/compromise` to data can cause significant damage
##### 2 main types of integrity 
Physical Data Integrity
* collection of actions and fail safes that `protect the physical systems that store and process the data`.

Logical Data Integrity
* Digital checks and protocols that protect data from `human error and hackers`.
> Ensure that data is correct and accurate when used in different ways in `organization`

##### Unauthorized Information Alteration
Threatens the integrity of `any process or outcome` based on that information

`Alteration Threats` 
* Financial, Health Records/Vote Totals/News Stories

`Tools that fight UIA`
* `FIM-File integrity monitoring`, `RDBMS records user access and data changes`

`Preserve data integrity`
* Prevent Unauthorized user access &
* Unauthorized data changes by authorized users
* Use error checking & data validation

#### Availability
* Ensure authorized users have `immediate and reliable` access to their data for instance thru `security questions & passwords`

`Non-Malicious Threats`:
* `hardware failure, unscheduled software downtime, network bandwidth issues`.

`Malicious Threats`:
* Various forms sabotage intended to `harm an organization`
* Eg: DDos attack that floods a website/server with traffic so that the server is down and users `cannot access the website`

`Protection Tools`
* Network monitoring, redundant hardware, `backup servers`
* If the primary system is compromised, business continuity and customer access can be maintained.

`Regulatory Standards/Contracts/Local Laws`
* `General Data Protection Regulation`, or GDPR, regulates digital privacy for all
countries in the European Union.
*  `Health Insurance Portability and Accountability` Act, or HIPAA, Regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information in America.
* Fines and penalities for non-compliance help companies keep `data safe, secure, accurate,
and private.`
