## Impersonation
Someone pretends to be something they are not

`Evil Twin` - hacker sets up public wifi network that seems legitimate
* Once a user connects, the hacker can intercept the userâ€™s login credentials, session information and PII.

2nd type:
* Hacker sets up a fake website that looks and feels
exactly like a real website.

`Social Engineering (Cons)`
* hacker pretends to be someone else to steal
data or take over systems.

> Hacker may use impersonation attacks individually or `in combination` with each other
* Eg: Hacker impersonates a bank that sends you a link to a `fake website` 
=> Impersonates the entity & the website
* They are trying to trick you so they can steal your credentials to the real site and install
malware on your device.

## Social Engineering (90% of security breaches)
* Attackers often use psychological manipulation to gain a person's trust to trick them into giving `sensitive information`
* Relies on urgency, fear and human error
* Can include `shoulder surfing, baiting, pretexting, and phishing`

`Shoulder Surfing`
* Occur in places like cafes, hotel lobbies, airports, and libraries.
* Hackers come to these places and `sit strategically` where they can watch your screen and keyboard to see usernames, passwords, PINs, and more.
* Unattended devices are also `prone` to installation of malware via `USB devices`, which can also be `done digitally` if connected to `public wifi` infected with malware.

> NEVER USE PUBLIC WIFI, LEAVE DEVICES UNATTENDED and use PRIVACY SCREENS

`Baiting (aka lure)`

Physical Lure:
* Object used to trick people to infect their own system 
* Eg: USB stick left unattended

Logical Lure:
* Software used to trick people to infect their own system 
* Eg: online ad where you have to press a link

`PreTexting`
* Attacker pretends to be `someone with authority`.
* Attacks use fear, intimidation, or sympathy to pressure you into revealing sensitive
data.

`Phishing`
* Type of social engineering where an attacker sends emails or texts to create a `sense of urgency and pressure`.
* Eg: "Bank sends email that says checking account was compromised & needs you to click a `link` to reset ur username and password`
* Once user logins, they are redirected to a fake website where their password were never reset, but attacker has stored their login `details` and login to their real account to transfer out funds

`Spear Phishing` - Targets specific individual

`Whaling` - Targets high-level executives

`Vishing` - Targets over phone w fraud & scams

> All phishing attacks involve tricking people to `reveal sensitive data or complete a task
that results in a security breach or identity theft`.

## Identity Fraud
* Identity theft is the act of `stealing` personal, private, or financial information from a person
with the intent of using it to commit fraud

* Identity fraud is the act of `using` the personal, private, or financial information stolen from victims to commit fraud.

* Criminals use stolen identities to apply for credit cards, open bank accounts, or take
out loans.
