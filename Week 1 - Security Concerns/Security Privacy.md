## Data & Information Assets
`Information asset` - information or data that is of value

Examples: Patient Records, Cust Info, Intellectual Property
* Can exist physically (paper, disk, other media) or `electronically` - databases, files

#### Information from data
Data analytics is when raw data like `values or facts` are used to create meaningful information

`Data` 
* Collected by automated systems - eg: page visits, link clicks, monthly sales

`Information`
* Summary of raw data 
* Eg: Positive/Negative results that happen after some specific change

`Insights`
* Conclusion based on information analysis results that produce insights for `meaningful biz decisions`.

`Intellectual Property`
* Creations of the mind that are `intangible`
* Protected by copyright, trademark and patent law
* Eg: `Industrial Designs, Trade Secrets, Research Discoveries, Some employee knowledge`
* NDA is used to prevent sharing of `sensitive info`

## Digital Products
* Intangible assets that a company owns
* Eg: Software, online courses, music etc
* Must be protected from `piracy and reverse-engineering`
* Source codes, licenses, and activation keys also need protection from hackers and insider threats.

#### Protection Mechanisms
* `Digital Rights Management (DRM)` is code added directly to files `that helps digital asset` from being copied or pirated although `there are tools` that can remove these copy protections
* The `Digital Millennium Copyright Act`, or DMCA, makes it illegal to bypass copy protections or to develop technology that helps bypass copy protections.

## Data-Driven Biz Decisions
> Getting right information is `key to getting data-driven biz decisions` to respond to real events

`Data Capture`
* Collection of data from `multiple sources` and secure storage of it in `relational databases` or `semi-structured data warehouses`.
* Sources include: `server logs`, `Iot Sensors` in home & biz apppliances, `reviews`

`Data Correlation`
* Raw data points are analyzed to `find correlations or links`
* AI & ML alogorithms automate part of the analysis
* `Meaningful reporting` - presentation of analyzed information in ways that help people to further analyze and interpret
> Data driven decisions are based on capturing data, correlating it and then using it to `create meaningful reports`

## Confidential Information
> Companies rank CI based on how sensitive the information is

There are 4 types of CI to be universally protected:
1. `Personally Identifiable Info` - Govt ID/birthdates etc
2. `Company Confidential Info` - information about companies's business processes & details they want to keep private. 
    * IP, DESIGNS, PROCEDURES, plans, records, financial data
3. `Customer Confidential Info` - info customers prpvide to companies, including PII, credit card info
4. `Protected Health Info` - any information added to person's medical record during diagnosis that can be used to identify them - PII/medical history, prescription lists etc

> PROPER confidentiality means:
* Restriciting access
* Not allowing unauthorized access/copies
* Storing information securely (encryption, firewalls, permissions etc)
* Destroying unneeded files

> Understand the difference: 
* `PII` != `PCI` (PERSONAL CUSTOMER INFO) 
* information that describes a customer
* `SPI` (Sensitive personal information) is information that does not identify but can cause harm if `made public`
