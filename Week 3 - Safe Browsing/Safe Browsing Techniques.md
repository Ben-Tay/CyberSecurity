## Autofill Management
> Autofill, or autocomplete, remembers and fills in
specific information like passwords or addresses in a web browser.

Best practices:
* Configure autofill categories such as passwords,
payment data, and addresses in your browser settings.
* When sharing devices with friends and family, set up guest accounts with different browser settings
* Configure syncing so that autofill is only applied to the devices and browsers you want.

## Browser cache and history 
> A browser cache is a storage area that holds downloaded web pages you’ve visited.
* Cached pages load immediately. If a page has changed since the last cache,
it is downloaded, displayed, and cached again.
* Over time, very large caches cause sluggish performance.

#### Browser History
> A browser history is a list of every page you've visited and for how long. Browser histories help you find sites you visited,but they can also be used against you by family, hackers, or law enforcement.

* Use browser settings to clear history and cache, and to set cache disk space and expiration dates.

## Private Browsing (Incognito)
> Private browsing doesn’t save browsing history, cookies, site data, or form data

With private browsing:
* You appear as a new or unknown user on the sites you visit,
* Other people who use the device won't see your history
* Cookies and site data are remembered while browsing but deleted when you exit the browser
* BUT private browsing activity isn’t hidden from your employer or school, or your internet service provider (or ISP),
    * The bookmarks you create will be kept.
    * Downloaded files are saved to your Downloads folder which may be visible to other users.

## Malicious websites 
> Mimic real websites to trick users into entering login or payment data and can install malware that gathers personal information or takes over a device.

Characteristics:
* Their URLs might use a zero instead of an “O” or a capital “i” instead of a lower case “L”.
* Their site pages often have typos or designs that
don’t match the legitimate site they are mimicking.
* If you accidentally visit and enter information into a malicious website, exit the site, run
antivirus and anti-malware, change your password, and (if needed) ask your bank for a new card

## Safe Website
> Identifying safe websites is more important than ever. 

Let’s review some safety tips:
* Use the Whois Lookup tool to see who owns a site. Missing contact information is a red flag.
* Look for reviews. Reddit and other social forums list scam sites and sites with security risks.
* Only visit HTTPS sites or your activity could be visible to online predators.
* Check the trust seal or security certificate information.
* And inspect URLs and site design to avoid malicious websites.
