## Free and open networks
Free and open networks are available in many places.
These networks are not encrypted.

Examples: `Airports/CoffeeShops/hotels etc`.

> Unsecure networks invite eavesdroppers to view everything you send and receive on that
network.
* They can potentially install malware on your device or hijack your session if your device
is not protected.

Public Connections are free to use but comes with a cost 
=> provider may sell ur data to other parties

## Public browsing risks
> If a hacker gets access to your device via public wifi, they have free rein over everything
on it and can even obtain the credentials to your banking or other websites you may have logged in to

* Most businesses have security measures to reduce the risk of connecting over wifi, but
there are still risks when using a public connection.

`Session Hijacking`
* Attacker intercepts and hijacks your connection
* Eg: Can take over your connection while your `logged into` a bank and transfer fund to an outside account.

* If public wifi is the only option, be sure to use firewalls, strong passwords, antivirus
and malware software, and VPNs.

## Instant Messaging
> Instant messaging systems are typically not designed with security features in place.

> Senders are `not authenticated`, and chats can be hijacked, and users impersonated.
* Information sent over chat is often in plain text.
That makes it easy to intercept and exploit, especially over public wifi connections.
* We should `never reveal sensitive data` over chat
* Files sent by chat are not scanned by computing devices. Avoid file transfers and links, even if they appear to be from someone you know.
* These are the easiest ways for hackers to plant viruses, spyware, keystroke loggers,
phishing scams, spam over instant messaging (SPIM), and a variety of worms.

## Internet Browser and Versions

#### HTTP
* Websites relying on the HTTP protocol are not secure, especially when visited over public
wifi.
* Everything that you send and receive is in plain text.It makes you an easy target for cybercriminals.

#### HTTPS
* Secure HTTP, or HTTPS, protocol provides an encrypted connection between you and the sites
that use it.
* Itâ€™s important to remember that HTTPS only provides a secure connection between you and
the web server.
* A site can use HTTPS and still try to scam users or be compromised in some way. `Does not guarantee that the site is safe`.
