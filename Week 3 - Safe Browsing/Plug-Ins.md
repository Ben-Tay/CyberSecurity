## Browsers
> In today’s remote and cloud-based world, the browser has become an important tool in
our daily lives.

Eg: Google chrome, MS edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari
* Browsers are often pre-installed, but are not typically set up in the most secure way.
* The Internet has many risks, so it is vital to configure and maintain browser security to `protect against those risks`

## Security zones and settings
> They block or allow websites and confine them to different zones such as the local network, Internet or intranet.
* Each zone can be `applied with different security levels`, medium for local network, high for internet, low for intranet.
* Security zones can also be configured to allow ActiveX and Java for added website interactivity
or functionality.But this can introduce risk.

> Modern browsers do not use zones.

## Plug-ins, extensions and toolbars
> Browser add-ons have evolved over the years.
#### Toolbars
> Toolbars were designed to add functionality to the browser like spellcheck, autofill, yellow pages and dictionaries
* But most toolbars were considered nuisance-ware.
* Some would show sponsored results instead of what you originally searched for, or they’d
impede system performance.
* Some even installed malware, tracked browsing habits, and collected user data.
* no longer forcibily installed 

#### Plug-Ins
> Plug-ins are site-specific browser add-ons that you click on to install.
* Third-party browser-add on, not supported by today's browsers

#### Extensions
> Is a small piece of source code that adds a function or feature to a browser.
* Ad-blockers and in-browser PDF readers are extensions.
* Since extensions are given special authorizations within the browser, they are `attractive targets`
for attackers.

## Cookies
> Cookies are text files with small pieces of data. When you visit a site, the server creates a cookie and saves it on your browser to track
you.

* This creates an easier, more personalized online experience. Most cookies are safe, but some are `designed to track without consent`.

`Session Cookies`
* Used only for 1 session and stored in `RAM`
* Automatically deleted when browsing session ends 

`Persistent cookies`
* Remains on a computer indefinitely
* Some have expiration dates

`Authentication cookies`
* Authentication cookies save logins, usernames, and passwords so you don’t have to remember
them.

`Tracking Cookies`
* Tracking cookies track multiple visits to the same site over time.
* Online stores use these to see how you shop and send targeted ads.

`First-party cookies`
* First-party cookies are from the site you are on.
* Safer on reputable sites

`Third-party cookies`
* Third-party cookies are from sites you are not on.
* These track you across the web.
* Ads can generate cookies, even if you never click on them.

`Zombie cookies`
* Zombie cookies are third-party cookies that don’t follow normal cookie protocols.
* They can store their code directly on your device to recreate themselves even after deletion.
* They are extremely difficult to remove
* Websites may also use zombie cookies to ban specific users.

## Security Certificates
> Security certificates, or secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates, authenticate a website’s
identity and enable an encrypted connection between a web server and a browser.

> SSL certificates come from organizations called root certificate stores or Certificates of
Authority, commonly called a CA.

`Root Certificate stores`
* Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, Google
* Which CA your device uses depends on the OS it is running

When you browse a website using HTTPS, you’re trusting the CA to validate the information
submitted by the business who has requested an SSL certificate.

> Businesses need SSL security certificates for their websites so they can:
* keep user data secure
* verify their ownership of the site
*  prevent attackers from creating fake versions
of their site, and to convey trust to users.
* They also need them if they want to have an HTTPS web address.

## Browser updates
> Because browsers are a favorite target for hackers, keeping them updated is very important.
* Browers by default, automatically update themselves. The updates are installed and applied when you restart your browser.
* If your desktop or laptop is part of a corporate network, your IT department may be managing
the configuration and manually applying updates to the browsers installed on your system.

> Hackers target browsers because they are the gateway between your device and the outside

> HTTPS can guarantee an encrypted connection but cannot guarantee that a site is not compromised.
