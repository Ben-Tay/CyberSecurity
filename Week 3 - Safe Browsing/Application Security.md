## Mobile Apps
> Mobile apps are designed to be functional and easy to use.
But they are not always the most secure.

Can be compromised by hackers to access:
* Texts, Contact Lists
* Files, Other valuable info

Using: Malware, weak passowrds, poorly designed apps

For better security:
* Use MFA, Strong Passwords, App store apps
* MFA requires a code to prove a login came from you (MS authenticator)

## Rooting & Jailbreaking
>Some users remove device restrictions so they can make changes and install non-approved apps
* Aka `rooting` on android phones and `jailbreaking` on Apple phones
* This adds functionality but also adds vulnerability

> To ensure a basic level of security, Apple and Google restrict certain device activities
and remove apps from their app stores if they donâ€™t meet security standards.

#### Desktop software
> Desktop software can be used to open any file stored locally or in the cloud.

#### Business software
> Business software automates transactions, mines sales data, manages resource and supply
chain information, and more.

Hackers target biz software w:
* Ransomware, zero-day attacks or other cyber attacks
* To steal sensitive data, or so they can sell and exploit it 
* Can cost millions and be devastating to consumers, businesses, organizations and governments

As a response:
* Businesses maintain employee education to ensure security best practices are followed, and they use strong tools to prevent, detect and respond to vulnerabilities and threats.

#### Corporate network
> To protect corporate files, systems, and resources, businesses must limit access

Alternatives to sharing instead of emails/usb drives:
* Internal network sharing on `company-owned` hardware
* Turn to cloud solutions for enterprise-level versions of Box, OneDrive or Google Drive.

> Company data should only be shared on a `need-to-know basis`. Insider theft of data and intellectual property is common, which can be prevented by `strict access control`. Need to find  a balance between access control and availability.

Consider the following:

`Consumer-Level cloud and sharing`
* Facebook, Instagram etc 
* Security not robust
* Hackers can steal & reuse passwords
