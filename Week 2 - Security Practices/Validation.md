## Software Sources Validation
> To reduce security risks, always be sure to get your software, cloud services, device
drivers, and firmware updates from legitimate sources like: 

* Vendor App Stores - Windows
* Authorized resllers - Bestbuy, Costco
* Original Equipment Resellers (OEM) - Dell, Samsung
* Software manufacturers - Adobe, Microsoft

> If downloading from website, make sure URL begins with HTTPS, click lock icon and see if certificate is still current and who owns it.

Avoid:
* Pirated software torrents, theyâ€™re loaded with malware.
* Software from untrusted sources
* Jailbreaking/rooting your phone

## OEMs vs 3rd-party websites 
> Original equipment manufacturers (or OEMs) provide drivers and firmware updates on their
websites.

* Dell, HP, Samsung, Nikon, NVidia, and mor
e all provide downloads for device drivers and firmware updates on their websites.

* Avoid 3rd party sites that claim to host drivers for the latest devices. These may be malware traps.

* Device driver software should also be digitally signed by the vendor, and the vendor's certificate
should be trusted by your computer.

> Old apps and bloatware leave devices vulnerable, so remove them
