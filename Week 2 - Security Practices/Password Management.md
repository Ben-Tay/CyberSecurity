## Password Cracking
> Getting a correct password in an `unauthorized way`

Examples: 
* `brute force` with many passwords hoping one would work
* `dictionary attacks` pull words from dictionaries or newspapers to crack passwords
* `rainbow attacks` use word from original password hash to `generate all other possible passwords`

#### Hashing
* Algorithm transforms an `input string (password)` into a smaller `fixed-length output string (hash)`.
* Hash acts like a digital footprint to store scrambled passwords
* Passwords are `hashed with a scrambling algorithm`, should an attacker figure out the password `hash` they can use it to unscramble similar passwords

## Managing Passwords
> Rather than using similar or same passwords, each online acount should have a `unique password`

> Conduct employee training to explain why password management & data security is important

`Password Policy`

Set of rules that provides guidance on `strong passwords`.
* Min-length of 12 characters
* Mix of upper/lower case, special characters and numbers
* Unique password for each account or device
* Mandatory password change every `6 to 12 months`.
* Employee training on cyberattacks.
* Notification to employees that the company will never ask for passwords.

Employees should never:
* Reuse or Recylce passwords
* Share passwords, not even with CEO
* Write down passwords
* Store passwords in digital file

## Creating better passwords
> Hackers can guess `1 trillion passwords/s`, they know that people tend to use quotes, dictionary words etc and they have database to these sources

* Ensure not to use names, places, PII etc

## Password Confidentiality
> Organizations should never ask customers or employees for their passwords.
* Makes employees less prone to impersonation & phishing attacks
* Do not share password with anyone - not even boss/IT department
