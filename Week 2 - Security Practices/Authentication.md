## Single-Factor Authentication
> Enter only one credential to log in

Example: Username & Password only

`Not safe from`:
- Keyloggers - malware installed to capture keystrokes
- Phishing
- Data breach information `sold on dark web`

> Anyone with your username & password `can do whatever they want with your account`.

## Two-Factor Authentication
> Enter two credentials to log in and are the best defence against `phishing and hijacking`.

* Typically  `hardware-based`, with most common being `security key` that plugs into a USB port
* Newer 2FA devices use `NFC` so the key only has to be near the device and not plugged in

## Multi-Factor Authentication
> Accessing a resource or device using MFA requires multiple authentication factors to log in, not just a password

MFA offers the following extra protection over SFA:
* Risk of data breach and phishing significantly reduced
* Can't be captured by keystroke loggers
* You control which factors you provide: `security  qns, phone, email etc`)
* But not 100% failproof, hackers continue to try to find or exploit vulnerabilities in such solutions

## Identification factors (SSO)
> Pieces of information that only you and an authentication service know.

They are:

`SOMETHING YOU KNOW`:
- Passwords
- PIN
- OTP
- Security qn answers

`SOMETHING YOU HAVE`:
* Phone/Email to receive OTP
* App that can generate OTP codes (MS authenticator)

`SOMETHING ABOUT YOU`:
* Fingerprints, retinas, face, voice
* Biometric scanners use these to authenticate you

## SSO (Single-Sign On)
> Verifies users for connected accounts or apps so they only have to log in once.

* Allows one to log in to `multiple applications` and platforms with 1 login
* Businesses use `SSO` to simplify and speed up access to resources.
* IT departments set up single sign on with vendors like Office365 or Salesforce.com so that `employees are automatically logged in when they sign into their work networks`
* Allows employees to continue working without `having to remember multiple passwords`.
